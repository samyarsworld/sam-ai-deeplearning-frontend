export const input1 = `Person A: Hey, I was thinking about grabbing some pizza for dinner.

Person B: That sounds like a plan! What toppings are you in the mood for?

Person A: I'm feeling adventurous today – let's go for something exotic. How about chicken tikka?

Person B: Nice choice! I'm down for that. Should we throw in some jalapeños for an extra kick?

Person A: Absolutely, let's spice it up a bit. Large or medium?

Person B: I say we go big – a large one should do the trick.

Person A: Cool. I'll place the order online. Did you want to add any sides?

Person B: Yeah, let's get some garlic knots and maybe a Caesar salad to balance it out.

Person A: Good call. Okay, order placed. They said it should be here in 45 minutes.

Person B: Perfect timing. I'll set up the living room for a pizza night.

[45 minutes later]

Person A: The pizza's here!

Person B: Sweet. Let's grab some slices and settle in for a movie.

Person A: Agreed. Thanks for helping decide on the toppings.

Person B: Anytime. This pizza night was a brilliant idea.

In quantum lensing, particles, such as photons, can be affected by both gravitational forces and quantum uncertainties simultaneously. This intricate interplay can lead to deviations in the expected paths of particles, creating lensing effects on a quantum scale. Unlike classical gravitational lensing, which is explained by general relativity, quantum lensing involves the probabilistic nature of quantum particles, introducing a layer of unpredictability to their trajectories. Scientists are exploring the potential applications of quantum lensing in fields such as quantum computing and information processing, leveraging the unique properties of quantum particles influenced by gravitational fields. The study of quantum lensing not only deepens our understanding of the fundamental nature of particles but also opens doors to innovative technological advancements in the realm of quantum physics.`;
